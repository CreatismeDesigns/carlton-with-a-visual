        <h1>Who is Carlton Banks?</h1>
        <p>Carlton Banks is a character from the TV show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." He's known for being kind of
            uptight and conservative, which creates a funny contrast with his cousin Will, who is more laid-back. One of
            the things he's really famous for is his quirky dance called the "Carlton Dance." It's a fun and memorable
            part of the show, and the character is played by actor Alfonso Ribeiro.</p>
        <p>Carlton is a highly rational, respectful, and caring individual; however, he can be annoying, naive, and
            cocky. He dresses preppy and is a conservative Republican who loves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jones_(singer)">Tom Jones</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin">Macaulay Culkin</a>. Carlton
            tends to have difficulty thinking about others and is often at odds with his cousin, <a href="https://freshprince.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Smith">Will Smith</a>, although he
            is Will's best friend and brother figure.</p>
