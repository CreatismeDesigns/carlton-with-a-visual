        <h1>Who is Carlton Banks?</h1>
        <p>Carlton Banks is a character from the TV show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." He's known for being kind of
            uptight and conservative, which creates a funny contrast with his cousin Will, who is more laid-back. One of
            the things he's really famous for is his quirky dance called the "Carlton Dance." It's a fun and memorable
            part of the show, and the character is played by actor Alfonso Ribeiro.</p>
